# The not-released files are meant to use upstream packages in binary form whenever possible.
# Packages get added here, if they are not released at all or when the repo's current version
# requires a newer version than the one currently released to the target distributions.
# Once Upstream packages are released and synced to the target distributions in the required
# version, the entry in this file shall be removed again.
