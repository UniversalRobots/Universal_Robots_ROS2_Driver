2.3.2 (2023-06-02)
------------------
* Adds full nonblocking readout support (Multiarm part 4)  - v2 (`#673 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/673>`_)
* Removed workaround also in export_command_interfaces (`#692 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/692>`_)
* Calling on_deactivate in dtr (`#679 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/679>`_)
* Fixed formatting (`#685 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/685>`_)
* Remove tf_prefix workaround in hw interface
* Ported controllers to generate_parameters library and added prefix for controllers (Multiarm part 2) (`#594 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/594>`_)
* Remove ur_bringup package (`#666 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/666>`_)
* Introduce hand back control service (`#528 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/528>`_)
* Apply suggestions from code review
* Update definition of test goals to new version.
* Wait longer for controllers to load and activate
* Fix flaky tests (`#641 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/641>`_)
  * Move robot startup into test's setUp function
  * Robustify robot startup
* This commits adds additional configuration parameters needed for multiarm support.

2.3.1 (2023-03-16)
------------------
* Adjust controller switching to message change
* Controller spawner timeout (`#608 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/608>`_)
  * Simplify controller spawner definitions
  * Ignore flake8 W503 as it clashes with black and goes against PEP8 style
  * Add argument to set controller spawner timeout
  * Use longer controller manager timeout in CI
  The default timeout of 10s is the same as our RTDE retry timeout, which
  means if RTDE does not immediately connect (which happens regularly in
  CI runners) controller spawning would fail.
* Increase timeout for first test service call to driver (`#605 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/605>`_)
* Contributors: Robert Wilbrandt, RobertWilbrandt

2.3.0 (2023-03-02)
------------------
* Fix cmake dependency on controller_manager
* Correct calibration correction launch file in doc
* Added services to set tool voltage and zero force torque sensor (`#466 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/466>`_)
  Added launch arguments for reverse ip and script command interface port.
* Fix comment in test file
* Default path to ur_client_library urscript (`#316 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/316>`_)
  * Change default path for urscript for headless mode.
  * Replace urscript path also in newer ur_robot_driver launchfile
  * Remove ros_control.urscript

* Clean up & improve execution tests (`#512 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/512>`_)
  * Clean up execution test files
  * Start ursim as part of the execution tests
  * Dont use custom dockerursim for humble and rolling execution tests
  * Clean up test implementations
  * pep257 fixes
  * Perform rolling and humble execution tests as part of normal pipelines
  * Increase admissible timeouts as the CI needs to pull ursim first
  * Add more debug messages during tests
  * Wait until robot is in POWER_OFF mode before trying to power it on
  * Fix error introduced in last commit
  * Add additional cmake option to enable integration tests
  * Increase timeout for robot tests
  * Add CMake comment describing the execution test integration
  * Run source tests on pull request
  This is only here for testing the test setup! Remove before merging
  * call resend_robot_program twice
  This seems to be necessary, as otherwise the robot hangs after bootup.
  The first program execution (that gets automatically started at driver
  startup because of the headless_mode) gets paused, since it is sent while
  the robotis not yet switched on. To mitigate this, we send the robot program
  again after switching on the robot, but this seems to stop the robot program.
  Sending it again seems to set it correctly to a started state.
  * Increase timeouts for dashboard_client tests
  Otherwise they can fail, since in parallel we pull and start the docker
  container.

* Update and thin down README (`#494 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/494>`_)

  Use ``activate_controllers`` instead of ``start_controllers``.
* Fix tool voltage setup (`#526 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/526>`_)
  * Move BEGIN_REPLACE inside of header
  * Change default value of tool_voltage
  Keeping this at 0 requires users to explicitly set it to non-zero. This way
  we won't accitentally destroy hardware that cannot handle 24V.
* Added dependency to socat (`#527 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/527>`_)
  This is needed for the tool forwarding.
* Add a note in the tool_comm doc about a URCap conflict (`#524 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/524>`_)
  * Add a note in the tool_comm doc about a URCap conflict

* Contributors: Felix Exner

------------------
* Made sure all past maintainers are listed as authors (`#429 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/429>`_)
* Silence a compilation warning (`#425 <https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/issues/425>`_)
  Since setting the receive timeout takes the time_buffer as an argument
  this raises a "may be used uninitialized" warning. Setting this to 0
  explicitly should prevent that.
