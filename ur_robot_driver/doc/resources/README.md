## 2021-10 ROS World presentation

[Presentation: Making a robot ROS 2 powered - a case study using the UR manipulators](2021-10_ROS_World_2021_Making_a_robot_ROS2_powered.pdf)

Summary:

  With the release of ros2_control and MoveIt 2, ROS 2 Foxy finally has all the “ingredients” needed to power a robot with similar features as in ROS 1. We present the driver for Universal Robot’s manipulators as a real-world example of how robots can be run using ROS 2. We show how to realize multi-interface support for position and velocity commands in the driver and how to support scaling controllers while respecting factors set on the teach pendant. Finally, we show how this real-world example influences development of ros2_control to support non-joint related inputs and outputs in its real-time control loop.
