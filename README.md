This is one of the very first ROS2 manipulator drivers. Some of the new features are enabled by ROS2 and include decreased latency, improved security, and more flexibility regarding middleware configuration. The package contains launch files to quickly get started using the driver as a standalone version or in combination with MoveIt2

This driver is developed on top of [Universal_Robots_Client_Library](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library) and support some key cobot functionalities like; pause at emergency stop, safeguard stop, automatic speed scaling to avoid violate the safety setting and manually speed scaling from the teach pendant. In addition the externalControl URCap makes it possible to include ROS2 behaviors in the robot program.

The driver is compatible across the entire line of UR robots -- from 3 kg payload to 16 kg payload and includes both the CB3 and the E-series.

## Known Issues

-

## Packages in the Repository:

  - `ur_bringup` - launch file and run-time configurations, e.g. controllers.
  - `ur_controllers` - implementations of controllers specific for UR robots.
  - `ur_dashboard_msgs` - package defining messages used by dashboard node.
  - `ur_description` - description files for the UR robots: meshes, URDF/XACRO files, etc.
  - `ur_moveit` - example MoveIt configuration for UR robots.
  - `ur_robot_driver` - driver / hardware interface for communication with UR robots.


## Getting Started

1. [Install ROS2 Foxy](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Foxy/Linux-Install-Debians/).

2. Make sure that `colcon`, its extensions and `vcs` are installed:
   ```
   sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions python3-vcstool
   ```

3. Create a new ROS2 workspace:
   ```
   export COLCON_WS=~/workspace/ros_ws_foxy_ur_driver
   mkdir -p $COLCON_WS/src
   ```

4. Pull relevant packages, install dependencies, compile, and source the workspace by using:
   ```
   cd $COLCON_WS
   git clone https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver.git src/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver
   vcs import src --skip-existing --input src/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver.repos
   rosdep install --ignore-src --from-paths src -y -r
   colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

## Using MoveIt

To use MoveIt some additional packages should be added into workspace:
   ```
   cd $COLCON_WS
   vcs import src --skip-existing --input src/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/MoveIt_Support.repos
   vcs import src --skip-existing --input src/moveit2/moveit2.repos
   rosdep install --ignore-src --from-paths src -y -r
   colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

## Hardware Setup

1. To enable external control of the UR robot from a remote PC you need to install the **externalcontrol-1.0.5.urcap** which can be found inside the **resources** folder of this driver or download the latest from [Universal_Robots_ExternalControl_URCap](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ExternalControl_URCap/releases).

**Note:** For installing this URCap a minimal PolyScope version of 3.7 or 5.1 (in case of e-Series) is necessary.

2. For installing the necessary URCap and creating a program, please see the individual tutorial on how to [setup a CB3 robot](/ur_robot_driver/doc/install_urcap_cb3.md) or how to [setup an e-Series robot](/ur_robot_driver/doc/install_urcap_e_series.md)

3. On the remote PC, launch the suitable launch file which starts the robot driver and controllers (see details in [Usage](#usage) section).

4. In the Program tab of the teach pendant, navigate to the URCaps section on the left and add the external control to the robot program by clicking on it. The program can then be executed by pressing the play button. Make sure the robot is turned on. The robot power status will be displayed on the bottom left.

## Usage

For starting the driver there are three main launch files in the `ur_bringup` package.

  - `ur_control.launch.py` - starts ros2_control node including hardware interface, joint state broadcaster and a controller. This launch file also starts `dashboard_client` if real robot is used.
  - `ur_moveit.launch.py` - start everything from `ur_control.launch.py` plus an example scenario with [MoveIt2](https://moveit.ros.org/).
  - `ur_dashboard_client.launch.py` - start the dashboard client for UR robots.

Also, there are predefined launch files for all supported types of UR robots.

The arguments for launch files can be listed using `ros2 launch ur_bringup <launch_file_name>.launch.py --show-args`.
The most relevant arguments are the following:

  - `ur_type` (*mandatory*) - a type of used UR robot (*ur3*, *ur3e*, *ur5*, *ur5e*, *ur10*, *ur10e*, or *ur16e*).
  - `robot_ip` (*mandatory*) - IP address by which the root can be reached.
  - `use_fake_hardware` (default: *false*) - use simple hardware emulator from ros2_control.
    Useful for testing launch files, descriptions, etc. See explanation below.
  - `fake_sensor_commands` (default: *false*) - enables setting sensor values for the hardware emulators.
    Useful for offline testing of controllers.
  - `robot_controller` (default: *joint_trajectory_controller*) - controller for robot joints to be started.
    Available controllers: *joint_trajectory_controller*, *scaled_joint_trajectory_controller*.
    Note: *joint_state_broadcaster*, *speed_scaling_state_broadcaster*, *force_torque_sensor_broadcaster*, and *io_and_status_controller* will always start.

    *HINT*: list all loaded controllers using `ros2 control list_controllers` command.

**NOTE**: The package can simulate hardware with the ros2_control `FakeSystem`. This emulator enables an environment for testing of "piping" of hardware and controllers, as well as testing robot's descriptions. For more details see [ros2_control documentation](https://ros-controls.github.io/control.ros.org/) for more details.

### Example Commands for Testing the Driver

- To start the robot driver and controllers, use:
   ```
   ros2 launch ur_bringup ur_control.launch.py ur_type:=ur5e robot_ip:=yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy use_fake_hardware:=true launch_rviz:=true
   ```
   For an offline test with the emulated hardware you can just copy-paste this line.
   To run on the hardware, write the IP address of your robot and omit the `use_fake_hardware` argument.

   **NOTE**: If controllers are not starting automatically, i.e., the robot state is not shown in rviz, you can start them manually:
   ```
   ros2 control load_controller --state start joint_state_broadcaster
   ros2 control load_controller --state start joint_trajectory_controller
   ```

   To check the controllers' state use `ros2 control list_controllers` command.

- Send some goal to the Joint Trajectory Controller by using a demo node from [ros2_control_demos](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control_demos) package by starting  the following command in another terminal:
   ```
   ros2 launch ur_bringup test_joint_trajectory_controller.launch.py
   ```
   After a few seconds the robot should move.

- To test another controller, simply define it using `robot_controller` argument:
   ```
   ros2 launch ur_bringup ur_control.launch.py ur_type:=ur5e robot_ip:=yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy robot_controller:=scaled_joint_trajectory_controller use_fake_hardware:=true launch_rviz:=true
   ```
   And send the command using demo node:
   ```
   ros2 launch ur_bringup test_scaled_joint_trajectory_controller.launch.py
   ```
   After a few seconds the robot should move (or jump when using emulation).

- To test the driver with the example MoveIt-setup, first start the controllers then start MoveIt. (This requires a `vcs import` of MoveIt packages):
   ```
   ros2 launch ur_bringup ur_control.launch.py ur_type:=ur5e robot_ip:=yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy use_fake_hardware:=true launch_rviz:=false

   ros2 launch ur_bringup ur_moveit.launch.py ur_type:=ur5e robot_ip:="xxx.xxx" use_fake_hardware:=true launch_rviz:=true
   ```
   Now you should be able to use the MoveIt Plugin in rviz2 to plan and execute trajectories with the robot.

5. If you just want to test description of the UR robots, e.g., after changes you can use the following command:
   ```
   ros2 launch ur_description view_ur.launch.py ur_type:=ur5e
   ```

## Expected Changes in the Near Future

- Using upstream `force_torque_sensor_broadcaster` (ros-controls/ros2_controllers#152)
- Trajectory control currently only supports position commands. In the future, velocity control will be added.


## Contributor Guidelines
Code is auto-formatted with clang-format 10 whenever a git commit is made. Please ensure these dependencies are installed:
  ```
  pip3 install pre-commit
  sudo apt install clang-format-10
  ```

Prepare the pre-commit formatting to run like this:
  ```
  pre-commit install`
  ```

## CI setup

There are three build stages checking current and future compatibility of the driver.

1. Binary builds - against released packages (main and testing) in ROS distributions. Shows that direct local build is possible.

1. Semi-binary builds - against released core ROS packages (main and testing), but the immediate dependencies are pulled from source.
   Shows that local build with dependencies is possible and if fails there we can expect that after the next package sync we will not be able to build.

1. Source build - also core ROS pacakges are build from source. It shows potential issues in the mid future.
